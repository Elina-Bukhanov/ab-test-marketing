# Revenue Optimization Hypotheses

## Hypothesis for RPM (Revenue per Mille)

**Current Observation**: The visibility and click-through rate of paid advertisements affect RPM.

**Hypothesis**: By moving payable advertisements to the upper part of the list, RPM will increase by 20%.

- **H0 (Null Hypothesis)**: By moving payable advertisements to the upper part of the list, RPM will not change.
- **H1 (Alternative Hypothesis)**: By moving payable advertisements to the upper part of the list, RPM will increase.

**Success Criteria**: An increase in RPM by at least 6% will be considered a successful outcome.

## Hypothesis for RPS (Revenue per Session)

**Current Observation**: The structure of the advertisement list impacts user engagement and the overall revenue per session.

**Hypothesis**: Repositioning payable advertisements to the top of the list will increase RPS by 15%.

- **H0 (Null Hypothesis)**: Repositioning payable advertisements to the top of the list will not affect RPS.
- **H1 (Alternative Hypothesis)**: Repositioning payable advertisements to the top of the list will increase RPS.

**Success Criteria**: An increase in RPS by at least 5% will be considered a successful outcome.

## Hypothesis for Revenue Increase

**Current Observation**: Users tend to click more on items positioned at the top of the list, leading to higher engagement and potential revenue.

**Hypothesis**: By moving payable advertisements to the upper part of the list, revenue will increase by 10%.

- **H0 (Null Hypothesis)**: By moving payable advertisements to the upper part of the list, revenue will stay the same.
- **H1 (Alternative Hypothesis)**: By moving payable advertisements to the upper part of the list, revenue will increase.

**Success Criteria**: An increase in revenue by at least 5% will be considered a successful outcome.

## Summary and Purpose

The primary goal is to increase revenue. However, understanding the factors that contribute to revenue growth is crucial. By testing RPM and RPS metrics, you aim to:
- Identify the impact of ad positioning on specific revenue metrics (RPM and RPS).
- Determine how changes in ad layout can influence overall revenue.

## Definitions

### RPM (Revenue per Mille)
**Definition**: RPM stands for Revenue per Mille (mille being Latin for thousand). It is a metric used to quantify the amount of revenue earned per 1,000 impressions or views.

**Formula**:
\[ \text{RPM} = \left( \frac{\text{Total Revenue}}{\text{Total Impressions}} \right) \times 1,000 \]

**Usage**: RPM is commonly used in online advertising to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. It helps in understanding how much revenue is generated for every 1,000 times an ad is displayed. Higher RPM indicates better monetization efficiency of ad placements.

### RPS (Revenue per Session)
**Definition**: RPS stands for Revenue per Session. It is a metric that measures the average revenue generated from each user session on a website or app.

**Formula**:
\[ \text{RPS} = \frac{\text{Total Revenue}}{\text{Total Sessions}} \]

**Usage**: RPS is useful for understanding the revenue performance in relation to user engagement. It indicates how much revenue is earned on average each time a user visits the site or app. By improving user engagement and optimizing session value, businesses can aim to increase RPS.
