# A/B Test Project

## Overview

This project aims to analyze the impact of different placements of paid and organic elements within a content feed on user interaction and revenue metrics. We conducted an A/B test on the Marketpele Feed platform to compare two versions of the content layout:

- **Group A**: An organic content element is placed at the top, followed by four paid advertisement elements.
- **Group B**: Four paid advertisement elements are placed at the top, followed by an organic content element.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this A/B test are:

- **Assess User Interaction**: Measure user engagement with paid and organic elements by tracking clicks and page views.
- **Optimize Revenue**: Determine which layout maximizes Revenue Per Mille (RPM) and Revenue Per Session (RPS).
- **Improve User Experience**: Understand the impact of content placement on the overall user experience, including the number of page views per session.

## Key Metrics

- **RPM (Revenue Per Mille)**: Revenue generated per thousand impressions.
- **RPS (Revenue Per Session)**: Revenue generated per user session.
- **CTR (Click-Through Rate)**: The percentage of users who click on paid and organic elements.
- **Sessions and Page Views**: Number of sessions and page views generated by users.

## Contents
- [Hypotheses and Explanations](Hypotheses_and_Explanations.md): Detailed hypotheses related to RPM, RPS, and overall revenue.

## Data

The dataset includes:

- **Date**: The date of the data collection.
- **Platform**: The platform used (mobile or desktop).
- **Publisher**: The specific publisher providing the content.
- **Group Name**: The group (A or B) indicating the layout used.
- **Page Views**: The number of page views during the test.
- **Visible Page Views**: The number of page views where the content feed was visible.
- **Marketpele Sessions**: The total number of sessions recorded on a publisher's site.
- **Paid Clicks**: The number of clicks on paid advertisement elements.
- **Organic Clicks**: The number of clicks on organic content elements.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this project, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to understand the performance metrics and to validate the effectiveness of different experimental groups. The key objectives of the EDA are:

1. **Metrics Calculation**:
   - **RPM (Revenue per Mile)**: Calculated as `(revenue / pageviews) * 1000`.
   - **RPS (Revenue per Session)**: Calculated as `revenue / sessions`.
   - **CTR (Click-Through Rate)**: Calculated as `sponsord_clicks / pageviews`.
   - **Paid CTR (Paid Click-Through Rate)**: Calculated as `sponsord_clicks / (sponsord_clicks + organic_clicks)`.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Column names were stripped of leading and trailing spaces.
   - Object columns were converted to numeric types where applicable.

3. **Unique Key Generation**:
   - A unique key was created for each row using the combination of `date`, `publisher_id`, `platform`, and `group_name` to ensure no key overlap between groups.

4. **Statistics per Group**:
   - Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) were computed for each metric within different groups to understand their central tendency and variability.

5. **Distribution Analysis**:
   - The distribution of key metrics across different groups was analyzed to understand the spread and central tendencies. This includes examining histograms and density plots to visualize how metrics vary within and between groups.

6. **Boxplots**:
   - Boxplots were created for numerical metrics to compare their distributions across different groups. This helps identify outliers and variations in metrics.
     
7. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - A correlation matrix was created to explore relationships between numerical features.

8. **Trend Analysis**:
   - Time series plots were generated to analyze trends in `revenue`, `rps`, and `rpm` over time.
     
9. **Pivot Tables**:
   - Pivot tables were created to summarize metrics by `date` and `group_name`.

### EDA Documentation

The details of the EDA, including the calculations and visualizations, are documented in the Jupyter Notebook file located in this repository:

- [EDA Analysis Notebook](https://github.com/Elina-Bukhanov/ab-test-marketing/blob/main/EDA.ipynb)

Feel free to review the notebook for a comprehensive analysis and visual representations of the data. Any findings and insights derived from this analysis are intended to help understand performance metrics and the impact of various factors on the results.


## Business Impact

The results of this test will inform the optimal layout of paid and organic content in the feed to maximize revenue and improve user engagement, leading to increased profitability for publishers.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: For data processing and analysis.
- **Git**: For version control and project management.
